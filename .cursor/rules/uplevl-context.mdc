# Uplevl Product Context

Uplevl is a modern AI-powered SaaS platform designed specifically for small, local, service-based businesses — including med spas, salons, personal trainers, dental clinics, and beauty studios. Its core mission is to automate social media marketing so business owners can grow their brand **without having to do the work themselves**.

This project represents the **mobile application** of Uplevl, built using **React Native and Expo**, and intended as the **primary touchpoint for customers**. It is where business owners upload their content, generate posts, review performance, and automate their marketing workflow.

## Core Promise

**Social Media on Autopilot.**  
Uplevl helps overwhelmed business owners stay visible, consistent, and professional on Instagram — without hiring an agency or learning complex tools.

## Key Product Capabilities

### 1. AI-Powered Post Generation

- Users open the app, take or upload one or more photos.
- They can add a short description or caption idea (optional).
- Uplevl uses AI to:
  - Analyze visual content for tone, activity, and themes.
  - Generate a warm, human-like caption in the voice of the business (e.g. a spa owner speaking to their regulars).
  - Suggest 3–5 relevant hashtags for reach.
  - Bundle uploaded photos into individual or drip-fed posts.

### 2. Content Batching & Drip Scheduling

- If multiple photos are uploaded, Uplevl automatically generates a sequence of posts.
- Users can preview and optionally edit posts before confirming.
- The drip engine schedules posts over time (e.g. one per day), so content appears consistently without manual effort.

### 3. Mobile-First Workflow

- The mobile app is the **core interface** for business owners — fast, easy, and distraction-free.
- Key flows:
  - Upload media (photos/videos)
  - Generate post suggestions
  - Review and approve the post queue
  - See performance insights at a glance

### 4. Engagement Insights (Minimal Analytics)

- The app provides simple but useful metrics:
  - Engagement per post
  - Follower growth
  - Conversions (e.g. clicks, bookings if connected)
- Emphasis is on **clarity, not complexity** — insights should feel empowering, not overwhelming.

## Technical Stack

## Target User Profile

Uplevl is built for small business owners who:

- Are not tech-savvy and don’t want to manage marketing tools.
- Don’t have time to post on Instagram but know it’s important.
- Want their brand to appear consistent, professional, and active online.
- Work primarily from their phone.

Typical user behavior:

- Snaps a photo of their work (e.g. a fresh manicure or patient result)
- Opens Uplevl, uploads the photo, and gets an AI-crafted caption
- Approves the post and moves on — marketing is done

---

## Product Tone & Design Philosophy

- **Calm and friendly** — the app should feel like a helper, not a dashboard
- **Minimalist UX** — every screen has one job
- **Zero learning curve** — everything just works
- **Optimized for speed** — users should be able to open the app, upload, and leave in under 60 seconds

## Cursor Context Notes

- Assume this mobile app is the **user-facing Uplevl product**.
- This is not an admin panel or internal tool — it’s the core experience for the customer.
- Prioritize **mobile UX**, fast interactions, and code simplicity.
- Focus on visual upload, AI captioning, and content scheduling flows.
